by arms, aye, abroad in foreign war, I did not loiter at home)
‘Home-steying youths have ever hemely wita’

bdnch difficulty has been made ol this verse because the
editors have combined armis belli and translated it ‘teate oi
war’: which was felt to be a harsh and almost impossible
phrase. Even Wagner does thie, though at the same time he .
quotes the eractly parallel passage oi Plautus (Epiri. 3, 4, 13)

which gives the elue.

. Nempe prem ia odoieeceatio
Memorem apud reyes ermtc, orte bellica,
· ι Diuitias magnae indeptam.
li any alteration is required it would be that oi bello ior belli:
which would more exactly correspond with orte bellico. ’

Two other ways have been adopted. Some editors arrange
the line thus: Simul rem et belli gloriam armis repperi: and
combine belii gloriam. But this alteration is unnecessery,
destroye the neatness ei the antithesis opem et gloriam, and in-
troduces a phrase scarcely preferable to betti armis (in the
passage gloriam belli ueterem recuperare, Caes. B. evii. 1, the
presence oi an adjective makes all the difference.)

l second attempt to emend the line ie e still less happy one.
Madvig (Emendationee Letoce p. 14) suggests belle. But belle
is not found elsewhere in Terence, and only twice for certain
in Plautus, (Gorool. 3, 5 is a disputed and almost hopeless
line.) and then with the sense ot irony or playiulness which
was attached to it in later writers Nil bene damsaetoe, sa·
ctae tamna omnia bella, Mart. 2, 7, 8. And Chremes is epeek-
ing in sober earnest, with no idea ol irony. lheve made no
alteration except in the stopping‚ therefore.

' ‹sd-eo, ‘up to that point' : ior the fact ol ad· in this compound
being followed hythe ablativo, compare qgood, praeterea. See
Ramsay’s Meet. Excurs. 1, pp. lii-180.

115. Bentley writes the line, ‘putauit me et aetate et bertrao-
leotio.' Ι have retained capientia because it is the reading ot
the Bembine ns, although beneuolentiae seems the better word,
'answering to prouidere plac, as aetate to plne scire, aa Bentley
explains.
