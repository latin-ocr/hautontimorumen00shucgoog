fo1mationl have been obliged te be content Though
¹ taking Fleckeisen's text in the main, I hare yet re
tained the older reading, where using my best con·
sideration I hare come to the conclusion either that
the alteration was not necessary, or not sufficiently
supported by authority, or that an alteration being
required, the right one had yet not been hit on ¹·
Since the publication of Wagners edition, Madvig's
Emmdatt‘ortcs batiaca have appeared, containing several
important emendations and remarks on the text oi
Terence. These I have referred to in my notes. As
to my commentar-y, which has been written with a
view rather to illustrate the meaning of Terence than
to dhcuss the genuineness oi the text (though that .
subject could not be wholly omitted), Ihare had before

1 me various works irom 911 oi which I have learnt

much. hhe edition of Westerhovius (1726)‚contains
the opinions oi the ancient grammarians, that oi Stall-
baum (1831) contains nearly all the illustrative matter
used by his successore. The most satisfactory help,
however, to the study of an author, is a complete con-
cordance or index: this is supplied by the Delphin
edition and by Pan-y 3 end this I have used con-
tinually. Zeume's edition (1774) Ihave not seen.

1My text differs from ffleckeisen's in the following
places: v. 5, 53, 112, 154, 160, 185, 216, 227, 232, 253, 238.
