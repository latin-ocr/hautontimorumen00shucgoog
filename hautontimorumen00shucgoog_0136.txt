wild improbability. W. buotes an answer given by the Gelts to
Alexander, that their greatest fear was μήποτε ὁ οὐρανὸς αὐτοῖς
ἐμπέσοι, meaning I suppose that they ieared nothing in the

raiaes,’ ‘whatever mistortune however nnlooked for and im·
probable happen to him.’ 01 Lnoian Prom. 192, aa τοῦτο

quoted by Wagner in his note to Plaut. Aut. 105: and by
Roby §1321,wh0 explains the usage aa arising troni several
souroes, viz. the looative use 01 animi, the objeotive genitive,
the genitive ottho seoondary object, and perhaps the Greek

usages. See Munro on Luor. i. 131, where he shows that the ·

use ia not eonfined to 001111. Wagner rejeots the theory of ita
being derived horn the Greek use 3 and Key [1931111016] argues
that animi is in truth a dative, and that the use ot the genitive
in other words bv later writers grew out 01 a false analogy 110111
