uella reali re esee expolitam muliebri. But though mala ree
muliebria is intelligible, erse hes nothing to depend on, and
cannot be defended It seems to have been introduced as
a means oi filling up the metra, aiter the mistake hed been
made oi reading mela ior malua. The Venetian edition oi
1479 has mali. 'Madvig (Emendationee Latinae, p. 15) would
read nulle rectae arte expolitam muliebri. But the emenda-
. tion in the textis simpler. Madvig was not the first to see
that mle was a mistake ior melus, and not the ieminine
ablativa oi melus. The old commentatore explained it in this
way, and Fabritius proposed to read natta re metae expolita '
tamt) muliebri. Bentley got out oi the difficulty (more suo)
by introducing interpolatam (Plaut. Moci. 1, 3, 145) ior esse
expolitam ‚· and Fleckeisen supposes a line to be lost; and in
this Wagner follows him.

The whole passage should be compared with Ptorrn.
105-6, Nil aderat adjumenti eol palchritudinem.- Cupiunt
paene, aedae pes, ipra horrida, lucryrwe, vestitus turpis.

290. prolixus, circum cunm. The omission oi et in a
climax is in Tereuce's manner (sec on 110). Fleck. reads
aproitoee et circum, etc. Bentley wrote capillus eparcus, pro·
mnam, circum eaput. For sparsus there is ‘che evidence oi

not how might he have written better?

294. texebatnna. cf. v. 285. pemmonem. cf. pannis

297. sordidatam ct sordidum, ‘iil-cled and ill-kept? cor·

in the passage oi Cicero quoted by st, Pie. 99, aec miuus
laetabor cum te semper sordidum quam ac' paullisper sordidatum
